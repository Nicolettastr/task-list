To-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The aim of this project was to help me gain a better understanding of how to create interactive web applications and practice working with these core web technologies.

Using HTML and CSS, I designed the layout and styling of the application, including the input field and task list. I then used JavaScript to create the functionality that allowed users to add and delete taks. I learned how to work with arrays to store and manipulate data, as well as how to use functions to create reusable blocks of code.
